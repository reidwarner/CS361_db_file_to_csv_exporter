Add a README to your GitHub (or update it if you already have one) that contains your communication contract. (Once you define it, don't change it! Your teammate is relying on you.) README must contain...
Clear instructions for how to programmatically REQUEST data from the microservice you implemented. Include an example call. Do not advise your teammate to use your test program or require them to, your teammate must write all of their own code.
Clear instructions for how to programmatically RECEIVE data from the microservice you implemented. Include an example call.
UML sequence diagram showing how requesting and receiving data works. Make it detailed enough that your teammate (and your grader) will understand.
